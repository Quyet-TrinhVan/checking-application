# Face Checking Application

A modular Python application for face recognition, anti-spoofing, and background analysis. Designed for secure, real-time identity verification in various environments.

## Features
- **Face Recognition:** Detect and identify faces from images or video streams.
- **Anti-Spoofing:** Prevents fraudulent attempts using photos, videos, or masks.
- **Background Analysis:** Analyzes scene context to improve recognition accuracy.
- **RESTful API:** Easily integrate with other systems via HTTP endpoints.
- **Modular Design:** Easily extend or replace components for custom use cases.
